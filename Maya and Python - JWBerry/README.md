# Maya and Python quickstart guide for designers!
Written By JW.Berry, inspired by Jacob Koehler

In this repo, there are numbered python files that have heavily commented code surrounding simple examples you can follow in Maya.
To start, *open Maya*, this works in the student version as well as the educational version. It hasn't been tested in Maya LT.

The first 5 files can work with a blank scene, and the 6th one needs a shape or model loaded before execution. There will be a video series on https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuDapMrhvybcYHfRphS9tiA (JW.Berry's YouTube Channel) that will explain the content of the files and how to use them more clearly.
